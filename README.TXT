I am recreating Porygon-2 from Pokemon with its trainer holding a Pokeball.  

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Fifth edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kšlling
   Pearson Education, 2012

It is discussed in chapter 1.
    
This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

This project is often used after studying the "shapes" project. It
adds a class to those ones in "shapes". That class (named "Picture")
uses the shapes to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with 
modifying source code.
